```

this looks ugly and is hard to read.

we should use a top notch formatting library in order to display a nice table view.

we should have a general pattern of using pretty formatting by default for commands,
 and then having a --json flag that all view-related commands flag

## Implementation

1. Research a proper terminal formatter to use throughout the project for issues like this
2. Write up new documentation on when and how to use it within `docs/ui/STDOUT-FORMATTING.md`. Describe using the formatter of choice as
 well as the new json flag
3. Implement proper table view for `jig ps` and json retun
4. Just do it for this command

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `jig ps` displays a satisfactory table view
- [ ] table view is disabled with --json flag
- [ ] examples of outputs included in the PR description
