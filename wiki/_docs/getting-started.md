## Requirements

- **Git** — For worktree management
- **tmux** — For agent session management
- **An ACA** — Claude Code recommended, but jig is designed to work with any terminal-based coding assistant

## Installation

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amiller68/jig/main/install.sh | bash
```

Then add shell integration to your profile:

```bash
# For bash (~/.bashrc)
eval "$(jig shell-init bash)"

# For zsh (~/.zshrc)
eval "$(jig shell-init zsh)"
```

Or build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amiller68/jig
cd jig
cargo install --path crates/jig-cli
```

## Initialize a repository

In your project root:

```bash
jig init claude
```

This scaffolds:

```text
.
├── jig.toml
├── CLAUDE.md
├── docs/
│   ├── index.md
│   ├── PATTERNS.md
│   ├── CONTRIBUTING.md
│   └── SUCCESS_CRITERIA.md
└── issues/
    ├── README.md
    ├── _templates/
    ├── features/
    ├── bugs/
    └── chores/
```

To also have the agent audit the codebase and populate the skeleton docs automatically, `--audit` launches the agent in a `jig-init` tmux session:

```bash
jig init claude --audit
```

You can pass extra instructions to guide the audit:

```bash
jig init claude --audit "We use pnpm, not npm. The API is actix-web."
```

For existing repos with customized docs, back up first so the agent can use them as reference:

```bash
jig init claude --force --backup --audit
```

Attach to the audit session with `tmux attach -t jig-init`.

## Configuration

Edit `jig.toml` to customize:

```toml
[worktree]
# base = "origin/main"
# on_create = "npm install"
# copy = [".env"]
```

## Your first spawn

1. **Create an issue:**

```bash
cp issues/_templates/feature.md issues/features/hello-world.md
```

Edit it with a clear description and acceptance criteria.

2. **Spawn an agent:**

```bash
jig spawn hello-world --context "Complete the task in issues/001-hello-world.md"
```

3. **Monitor:**

```bash
jig ps                    # See all workers and their status
jig ps -w                 # Live watch mode (updates every 2s)
jig ps -g                 # Global mode — workers across all repos
jig attach hello-world    # Attach to the agent's tmux session
```

4. **Review and merge:**

```bash
jig review hello-world    # See the diff
jig merge hello-world     # Merge if approved
jig remove hello-world    # Clean up
```
