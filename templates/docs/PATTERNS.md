# Coding Patterns

Document your team's coding patterns and conventions here. This helps AI agents and contributors follow consistent practices.

## Error Handling

<!-- How does your project handle errors? Examples:
- Return Result<T, E> types (Rust)
- Throw/catch exceptions (Python, JS)
- Error codes and errno patterns (C)
- Custom error types and their usage
-->

## Module Organization

<!-- How are files and modules structured? Examples:
- One file per class/component
- Feature-based folder structure
- Domain-driven design boundaries
- Barrel exports / index files
-->

## Naming Conventions

<!-- Your naming patterns. Examples:
- camelCase for functions, PascalCase for types
- snake_case for files and modules
- Prefix conventions (I for interfaces, _ for private)
-->

## Output Conventions

<!-- How does your CLI/app communicate? Examples:
- stderr for errors and diagnostics
- stdout for machine-readable output
- Logging levels and when to use each
- JSON output for scripting
-->

## Testing Patterns

<!-- How to write tests in this codebase. Examples:
- Unit test file locations and naming
- Integration test patterns
- Mock/stub conventions
- Test fixture organization
-->

## Common Idioms

<!-- Project-specific patterns. Examples:
- Builder patterns for complex objects
- Repository/DAO patterns for data access
- Event/message conventions
- Dependency injection approach
-->
